Circuits is essential for embedded systems because it provides the theoretical foundation for how electrical signals behave in hardware.
Embedded engineers must understand voltage, current, impedance, and transient behavior to correctly interface microcontrollers with sensors, actuators, and power sources. Without circuit theory, it is impossible to analyze signal conditioning, power regulation, noise, timing effects, or hardware limitations that directly affect embedded software behavior.
